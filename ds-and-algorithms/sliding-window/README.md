# 🪟 sliding-window

**Pattern:** The sliding window pattern uses a range of elements that expands or shrinks while traversing an array or string. Instead of recalculating values for every subarray, the window moves forward while maintaining useful information (such as sums, counts, or frequencies). This pattern is commonly used for substring, subarray, and longest/shortest condition problems.
