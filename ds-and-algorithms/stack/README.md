# 📚 stack

**Pattern:** The stack pattern processes elements in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, allowing efficient tracking of previous states or elements. Stacks are commonly used when problems involve nested structures, matching pairs, or needing access to the most recent unresolved element. This pattern appears frequently in parentheses validation, monotonic stack problems, and expression evaluation.
