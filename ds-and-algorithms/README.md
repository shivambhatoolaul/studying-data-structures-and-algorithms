This folder contains my interview preparation notes for data structures and algorithms based interviews—organized around common problem-solving patterns rather than individual problems. Most of the content here follows the [🧩 NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/practice/practice/neetcode150) problem set as a structured baseline. 

Each pattern's folder includes:
- A `README.md` file containing:
    - A summary of what the pattern is and when it is best used
- `.md` file(s) containing:
    - A problem with a solution that uses this pattern, and the its key takeway(s)

> ⚠️ The goal is not to memorize solutions, but to build pattern recognition that transfers across problems.
