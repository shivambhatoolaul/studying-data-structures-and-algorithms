This repository contains my data structures and algorithms (DSA) notes for interviews. 

I created this repository after running into the same feeling repeatedly: before interviews, it seemed like I had to relearn DSA concepts from scratch because there are many, and I couldn’t tell what I had truly forgotten... To prevent that, I’m revisiting the material—one last time—and documenting everything I study—so my future self can quickly review concepts when needed.

The repository is organized into DSA pattern folders that include:
- a `README.md` summarizing the pattern and when to use it,

- `.md` file(s) with example problem(s) from [🧩 NeetCode150](https://neetcode.io/practice/practice/neetcode150), `python` solution(s) using the pattern, and key takeaways.

> ⚠️ The goal is not to memorize solutions, but to build pattern recognition that transfers across problems.
