# 👉 two-pointers

**Pattern:** The two pointers technique uses two indices that move through a data structure (usually an array or string) to reduce time complexity. Instead of nested loops, pointers move toward each other or in the same direction to efficiently search, compare, or modify elements. This pattern is commonly used in sorted arrays, palindrome checks, pair sum problems, and in-place operations.
