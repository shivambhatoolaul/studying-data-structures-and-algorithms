# 🪟 sliding-window

**Pattern:** The sliding window pattern maintains a contiguous range of elements that expands or shrinks while traversing an array or string. Unlike the general two pointers technique, both pointers work together to represent a valid “window” whose state (such as sum, count, or frequency) is continuously updated instead of recomputed. This pattern is commonly used for substring or subarray problems involving longest, shortest, or fixed-size conditions.
