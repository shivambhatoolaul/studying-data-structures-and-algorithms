# 🔍 binary-search

**Pattern:** Binary search repeatedly divides a search space in half to efficiently locate a target or boundary condition. Instead of scanning linearly, the algorithm eliminates half of the remaining possibilities each step. This pattern is commonly used on sorted data or whenever a monotonic condition allows narrowing the answer range.
