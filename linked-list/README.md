# 🔗 linked-list

**Pattern:** Linked lists store elements as nodes connected by pointers rather than contiguous memory. Problems typically involve traversing, modifying, or restructuring node connections efficiently without shifting elements. This pattern commonly uses pointer manipulation techniques such as fast and slow pointers, reversal, or node insertion and deletion.
